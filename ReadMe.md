This Object-Oriented Programming project aims to create an application for managing activities and training plans for fitness enthusiasts. The application tracks and monitors physical activities, each with specific characteristics like distance, repetitions, and weight usage.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Class Design: Designing classes for users, activities, and training plans with appropriate attributes and methods
- Inheritance and Polymorphism: Utilizing inheritance to create specific types of activities and users, allowing for polymorphic behavior
- Encapsulation: Implementing encapsulation to protect data and ensure proper access through getters and setters
- MVC Architecture: Structuring the application using the Model-View-Controller pattern for separation of concerns
- Object Relationships: Managing relationships between objects, such as users and their activities or training plans
- Data Persistence: Implementing methods for saving and loading object data to and from files
- Behavioral Methods: Creating methods that define object behaviors, such as calculating calories burned or generating training plans
- Modularity: Ensuring a modular design to facilitate maintenance and collaboration
